                Today I worked on the JavaScript to populate the new recipe page. Its going pretty well, nothing too crazy. I started wondering how to best pass the added ingredients to the server the user is ready to generate their recipe and I decided to create a list in JavaScript. Right now every time a user adds an ingredient it gets added to the list. But for some reason when they click the remove button it won't remove it from the list. Here is the JavaScript:
                <br><br>
                ingredientsInclude = ingredientsInclude.filter(item => item != ingredient.textContent);
                <br><br>
                I'm going to have to figure out why its not working, and its probably something simple but I don't have it in me today to figure it out.
            </p>

            <p>
                I began adding the new recipe process. And I found the main navigation icons I want to use. I can't decide if when the user presses the "+" for a new recipe if the menu should expand to show:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>AI Assisted Recipe</li>
                    <li>Blank Recipe</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                Or if when the user presses the button it should take them to a separate screen that starts with a drop down with those two options, and based off of their selection I use JS to build out the appropriate form.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                After working on it for a little while I decided on a drop down on a new page that will then add the appropriate form to the new recipe page based on their selection. It will then hide the drop down to prevent the user from changing it by accident midway through the process.
            </p>
            <h4>TO ADD:</h4>
            <p>
                This could look really dumb, but I want to change the bullet points for "&lt;ul&gt;" to be üçΩÔ∏è or some other food-related emoji.

                Today I started creating the python server and the home page for cooks corner. So far its just been super basic blocking things out. After I finish blocking on the homepage I'll start the new recipe process. After clicking the new recipe button, the user will need to select create recipe using AI or add personal recipe (I don't love the way add personal recipe sounds, so that'll probably change). If the user selects AI Recipe they will be directed to a form that will ask what ingredients they want to include and which they want to exclude. As I refine this process I may add more options like add the category you want to make, i.e. soup, pasta, pizza, mexican, casserole, etc. ...Actually as I type this out... I'm just going to add that from the start. The form will ask for ingredients, things to avoid, and category of food.
            </p>
            <h4>Concerns</h4>
            <p>
                As I'm beginning to rebuild the project, I have the old source code open. But as I'm looking through it I'm afraid to copy too much of it because I really don't want to end up with the same spaghetti code that I had before. The reason I wanted to start this project from was to be able to better structure the code as well as create a more cohesive design.

                Today I created the wireframe for the websites main feed. This will be where you can see all of the recipes posted by users you follow. Each recipe will have its own 'card'. The card will have a header with the recipe title as well as the user name. The card will then show the A.I. generated image of the recipe and the recipe description. under that it will show a preview of the comments on the post as well as reviews.
                <br><br>
                To see the full recipe the user needs to click anywhere on the image, description or header areas. After clicking this area the card will flip over and expand. The image will shrink and move to the left, the description will move up and next to the image. The rest of the card will show the ingredients and the instructions. The expanded card will be scrollable depending on how much of an overflow the content has. In mobile the card won't get wider it will just take up the full screen and become scrollable.

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
                Cooks Corner is a project that I've been working on for quite a while. I have/had a working local copy of the site but the project had many short comings. The project was a lot of spaghetti code and lots of repeated code. I have learned a lot about how to plan and structure a project and have made the decision to start over. I will be using the portions of the old project as I move forward but I wanted to be able to have a fresh start so that I could tackle the project in a smarter way.
                <br><br>
                As I continue to work on Cooks Corner I will be posting on this page to provide updates and log the history of the project.
            </p>
            <h4>Project Update</h4>
            <p>
                This week I have been working on this project landing page. I have created the Home Page, started the Dev Log, and added the old project to its own folder on GitHub called OLD-COOKS-CORNER. I wanted to preserve the old project and have quick access to the old source code. Right now I've just been adding the rough build of this home page. This week I'll be adding styling to this homepage as well as creating the wireframe for Cooks Corner.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I've been working on selecting colors and Typography for the site plan. And I'm awful at choosing colors. I found a color palette that I liked but I don't feel like they really mesh that well. I'll need to adjust them still.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I talked to Amber and we agreed that the background color needed to be lighter. So I lightened it up and I'm a lot happier with the look of the site. I finished adding the site styling and now just need to finalize the wireframe.
