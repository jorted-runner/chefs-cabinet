                Today I created the wireframe for the websites main feed. This will be where you can see all of the recipes posted by users you follow. Each recipe will have its own 'card'. The card will have a header with the recipe title as well as the user name. The card will then show the A.I. generated image of the recipe and the recipe description. under that it will show a preview of the comments on the post as well as reviews.
                <br><br>
                To see the full recipe the user needs to click anywhere on the image, description or header areas. After clicking this area the card will flip over and expand. The image will shrink and move to the left, the description will move up and next to the image. The rest of the card will show the ingredients and the instructions. The expanded card will be scrollable depending on how much of an overflow the content has. In mobile the card won't get wider it will just take up the full screen and become scrollable.

                Cooks Corner is a project that I've been working on for quite a while. I have/had a working local copy of the site but the project had many short comings. The project was a lot of spaghetti code and lots of repeated code. I have learned a lot about how to plan and structure a project and have made the decision to start over. I will be using the portions of the old project as I move forward but I wanted to be able to have a fresh start so that I could tackle the project in a smarter way.
                <br><br>
                As I continue to work on Cooks Corner I will be posting on this page to provide updates and log the history of the project.

            <h4>Project Update</h4>
            <p>
                This week I have been working on this project landing page. I have created the Home Page, started the Dev Log, and added the old project to its own folder on GitHub called OLD-COOKS-CORNER. I wanted to preserve the old project and have quick access to the old source code. Right now I've just been adding the rough build of this home page. This week I'll be adding styling to this homepage as well as creating the wireframe for Cooks Corner.

                I've been working on selecting colors and Typography for the site plan. And I'm awful at choosing colors. I found a color palette that I liked but I don't feel like they really mesh that well. I'll need to adjust them still.

                I talked to Amber and we agreed that the background color needed to be lighter. So I lightened it up and I'm a lot happier with the look of the site. I finished adding the site styling and now just need to finalize the wireframe.
