                Cooks Corner is a project that I've been working on for quite a while. I have/had a working local copy of the site but the project had many short comings. The project was a lot of spagehti code and lots of repeated code. I have learned a lot about how to plan and structure a project and have made the decision to start over. I will be using the portions of the old project as I move foward but I wanted to be able to have a fresh start so that I could tackle the project in a smarter way.

                As I contiue to work on Cooks Corner I will be posting on this page to provide updates and log the history of the project.

            <h4>Project Update</h4>
            <p>
                This week I have been working on this project landing page. I have created the Home Page, started the Dev Log, and added the old project to its own folder on GitHub called OLD-COOKS-CORNER. I wanted to preserve the old project and have quick access to the old source code. Right now I've just been adding the rough build of this home page. This week I'll be adding styling to this homepage aswell as creating the wireframe for Cooks Corner.
