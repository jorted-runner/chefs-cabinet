# What is Chefs Cabinet

Chefs Cabinet is a recipe-sharing website. It harnesses AI to help users generate recipes based on the ingredients they actually have. Users can share recipes they have generated as well as their own creations. As users discover recipes, they can create Cookbooks to store these recipes. They can then use AI to generate a shopping list based on any of their Cookbooks to streamline their shopping process. Users can rate and review recipes they have cooked, or comment on recipes they find interesting.
